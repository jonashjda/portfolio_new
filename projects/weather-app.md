## Content Analysis Extension

The **Content Analysis Extension** is a powerful browser tool designed to evaluate the content of web pages for political bias. This extension extracts the text from any webpage, processes it securely through an integrated backend server, and uses OpenAI’s state-of-the-art AI models to deliver insightful analyses directly within the browser.
