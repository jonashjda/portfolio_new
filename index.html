            <h1>Exploring Ideas Through AI-Assisted Development</h1>
            <p>
                In my spare time, I like to “vibe-code”, which means using AI tools, curiosity, and a lot of experimentation to turn ideas into working projects.
                At least, that's how ChatGPT would describe it. In simpler terms, it means using AI to code with.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without a traditional computer science background, I’ve learned by building: starting with a concept, getting it running as quickly as possible, and refining it through trial, error, and iteration.
                AI fills in the technical gaps, allowing me to quickly iterate and improve my ideas and their technical implementation.
            </p>
            <p>
                My educational background in the intersection between IT, business, and communication shapes how I think about user experience and problem-solving, but my projects are ultimately about exploration.
                Some are polished, others are rough around the edges, but each one taught me something new and gave me something real to share - and that’s what keeps me coming back to build the next one!
            </p>
            <p>
                I also like messing around with AI in other ways, whether it's automation flows or implementing AI in my "vibe-coding" projects, 
                I find that AI can offer great opportunities with a relatively low barrier of entry.
                In addition to my projects, I'm also working on a blog where I share my thoughts and experiences with AI-assisted development and other related topics as a way to document and reflect on the things I learn throughout.
